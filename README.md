# technology-group

The SNAC Technology Infrastructure Working Group (TIWG) supports the development of the application by:
* Providing advisory support to the technical team
* Providing user-friendly documentation to support SNAC Working Groups and general users
* Cultivating community development

TIWG meets regularly to discuss ways to improve the use and understanding of the SNAC application. Below are some examples of the tasks we are undertaking.

### Advisory support incudes
* Beta-testing usability and feature updates in the application; [guidelines available](https://github.com/snac-cooperative/snac/wiki/Beta-Testing)
* Developing a post-SNACSchool questionnaire survey to deliver feedback to the technical team
* Developing specs for an external dashboard for scoped data clean-up projects

### Creating documentation such as
* EAC-SNAC JSON crosswalk
* Screencasts of application functionality
* Develop use cases for using SNAC API 

### Community development involves
* Publishing helpful documentation online for public access
* Coordinating with the SNAC Communication team to provide outreach
* Discussing collaborative or parallel developments with the SNAC API with other developers, such as, ArchivesSpace
* Exploring avenues and tools for data cleanup -- SNAC editathon, anyone?
